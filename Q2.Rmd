Q2. As Bill and Scott have the same contract and terms, the repayment is the same.
```{r}
#a The amount fo annual loan repayment for Scott 
Scottloan=annualrep
Scottloan
```




As Scott has an offset account and he can utilise the interest and the principal amount to pay the home loan. The term of the loan will reduce.

```{r}
#b To find the term of loan repayment with offset account, we first create a function with the variable 'n' and then use the uniroot function to solve for the n term for loan repayment.
loan=600000
int=0.035
offsetacc=100000
loanrepay=annualrep+(offsetacc*int)
loanrepay
```








```{r}
f=function(n){
  repayment=c(rep(loanrepay,30))
  v=1/(1.035)^n
  PV=sum(repayment*v)
  return(500000-PV)
}
# The uniroot calculates n as 22.48 years. 
uniroot(f,c(0,30))
```
So the last payment will be made 23 years later ; 19th march 2042




2(B)
As scott has an offset account and he can use the interest and principle to pay the
home loan. Each payment will be larger and reduce the term of home loan. To
include the interest from offset account as repayments, the present value of total
loan owned is 500000 and scott need to pay the annaul payment 32622.8. the bank
will receive 36133.8 (32633.8+3500) every year and using 500000=32622.8*ùëéùëõ to
find out n at 3.5%.
```{r}
. 
AB22=600000*(1.035)^22-loanrepay*(((1.035^22)-1)/0.035)
AB23=AB22*1.035
lastpay=AB23-3500-100000
lastpay
```
